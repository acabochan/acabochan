# 👋 Hi, I'm Andrea!

I'm a **creative technologist** exploring the intersection of **full‑stack development, machine learning, and technical art**. I love building projects that blend thoughtful design with strong technical foundations—especially those with social impact, accessibility, or creative expression at their core.
